0/Entrance/"You are in an underground laboratory abandoned a long time ago... You have no idea how you got here. The exit door is locked but there is an open door on the left. An old gun and a bottle of water on the table."
1/Cabinets/"There are a lot of cabinets in this room, most of them locked and empty. You found an old overalls in a closet, it looks good. Entrance door on the left. There is also a door ahead and it can be opened."
2/Wide Corridor/"Empty and quite wide corridor. It looks a little dangerous... You can't see very well due to dim light but you hear some strange sounds. There are two doors right ahead and on the left."

4/Small Experiment Room/"Broken glass, lots of furniture and scary mice, a door ahead, half eaten... The door you entered is behind. Suddenly you notice a strange anteater-like creature hiding behind the tables."
5/Very Narrow Corridor/"There are a lots of pigeons. A strong light shines through the gap in the door ahead... You can go back through the door behind you."
6/Laboratory/"The liquids inside the tubes have spoiled, and there are strange-looking, rotten animal corpses inside. Mice are everywhere... It smells oo bad that you want to turn around and leave. While looking around, you discover that there is a 'secret door' behind a cabinet on the left."
7/Behind the Secret Door/"The room feels like a nuclear facility. The room stretches upward like there is no end. A strange, not very large, glowing object in the middle; like a small rock..."
